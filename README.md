Responsive Eployee Directory / treehouse project 8

Use an API to Create an Employee Directory

Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and with vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information quickly and easily.

This project uses the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees”, and use that data to build a prototype for a company's employee directory. It will request a JSON object from the API using fetch and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
